"""
Yield
*****

Inside a program, when you call a function that has a yield statement, as soon as a yield is encountered, the execution of the function stops and returns an object of the generator to the function caller. In simpler words, the yield keyword will convert an expression that is specified along with it to a generator object and return it to the caller. Hence, if you want to get the values stored inside the generator object, you need to iterate over it.

It will not destroy the local variablesâ€™ states. Whenever a function is called, the execution will start from the last yield expression. Please note that a function that contains a yield keyword is known as a generator function. 

When you use a function with a return value, every time you call the function, it starts with a new set of variables. In contrast, if you use a generator function instead of a normal function, the execution will start right from where it left last.
